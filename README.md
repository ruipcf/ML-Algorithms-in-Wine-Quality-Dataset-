## Machine Learning algorithms applied in Wine Quality Dataset

The focus of this project was not to achieve the best results possible but to test different models and tools for data visualization.

### Algorithms studied:
   - Linear Regression (Random Forest Regressor)  
   - Classification (Rnadom Forest Classifier)  
   - Clustering (KMeans, MeanShift and GaussianMixture)  
   - Dimensional Reduction (PCA, KernelPCA, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis)  
  
### Setup
           
     install Requirements with:
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
